## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run or contribute to this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The project is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed to run or modify the code.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The project uses a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed and know how to create a database.
- A Go IDE or text editor: While not strictly necessary, a Go IDE or a text editor with Go support can make it easier to work with the code. I use vscode.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): You'll need Git to clone the repo.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): OptiVest uses Redis for caching to enhance performance and reduce API load.
- [OptiVest-Predictor-Microservice](https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest_Finance_Predictor_Micro_Service_V1): Clone and ser up this micro-service, which is esential for financial predictions and recommendations
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd optivest
    ```
3. **Install the Go dependencies:** The Go tools will automatically download and install the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file when you build or run the project. To download the dependencies without building or running the project, you can use the `go mod download` command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
4. **Set up the database:** The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create a new database and update the connection string in your configuration file or environment variables.
We use `GOOSE` for all the data migrations and `SQLC` as the abstraction layer for the DB. To proceed
with the migration, navigate to the `Schema` director:
```bash
cd internal\sql\schema
```
- Then proceed by using the `goose {connection string} up` to execute an <b>Up migration</b> as shown:
- <b>Note:</b> You can use your own environment variable or load it from the env file.

```bash
goose postgres postgres://aggregate:password@localhost/aggregate  up
```

5. **Download and Setup the MIcroService:** Follow the instructions highlighted [here](https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest_Finance_Predictor_Micro_Service_V1) to get the micro-service up and running.

6. **Environment Variable Setups:** OptiVest uses a few external APIs. You will need to set them up and make an `.env` containing the following templates:
```bash
# DSN Link to our Postgres database
OPTIVEST_DB_DSN=postgres://optivest:yourpassword@localhost/optivest?sslmode=disable
# For deployment: , comment the above and uncomment the below DSN
#OPTIVEST_DB_DSN=postgres://optivest:yourpassword@host.docker.internal/optivest?sslmode=disable
OPTIVEST_DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxxxxxx

# Mailer configuration
OPTIVEST_SMTP_HOST=xxxxx
OPTIVEST_SMTP_USERNAME=xxxxxx
OPTIVEST_SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxxxxx
OPTIVEST_SMTP_SENDER=Optivest <no-reply@optivest.tech>

# Exchange Rate API
OPTIVEST_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
# Alpha Vantage API
OPTIVEST_ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=xxxxxx
# Fred API
OPTIVEST_FRED_API_KEY=xxx
# Financial Modeling Prep API
OPTIVEST_FINANCIALMODELINGPREP_API_KEY=xxxxx
# Samba Nova LLM API
OPTIVEST_SAMBA_NOVA_LLM_API_KEY=xxxx
# Optivest Predictor Microservice
OPTIVEST_PREDICTOR_API_KEY=xxx
# OCR.Space API
OPTIVEST_OCRSPACE_API_KEY=xxxx
```
**The above .env is self explanatory for each API needed**

5. **Build the project:** You can build the project using the makefile's command:

    ```bash
    make build/api
    ```
    This will create an executable file in the current directory.
    <b>Note: The generated executable is for the windows environment</b>
      <b>- However, You can find the linux build command within the makefile!</b>

6. **Run the project:** You can run the project using the `go run` or use <b>`MakeFile`</b> and do:

    ```bash
    make run/api
    ```

7. **MakeFile Help:** For additional supported commands run `make help`:

  ```makefile
  make help
  ```
**output:**
```bash
Usage:
run/api: Run the API server
run/api/origins: Run the API server with CORS origins
db/psql            -  connect to the db using psql
build/api          -  build the cmd/api application
```

### Description

The application accepts command-line flags for configuration, establishes a connection pool to a database, and publishes variables for monitoring the application. The published variables include the application version, the number of active goroutines and the current Unix timestamp.
  - This will start the application. You should be able to access it at `http://localhost:4000`.

Using `make run`, will run the API with a default connection string located 
in `cmd\api\.env`. If you're using `powershell`, you need to load the values otherwise you will get
a `cannot load env file` error. Use the PS code below to load it or change the env variable:

```powershell
$env:OPTIVEST_DB_DSN=(Get-Content -Path .\cmd\api\.env | Where-Object { $_ -match "OPTIVEST_DB_DSN" } | ForEach-Object { $($_.Split("=", 2)[1]) })
```

Alternatively, in unix systems you can make a .envrc file and load it directly in the makefile by importing like so:
```makefile
include .envrc
```

A succesful run will output something like this:

```bash
make run/api
Running API server..
go run ./cmd/api
{"level":"info","time":"2024-1","caller":"api/main.go:374","msg":"Loading Environment Variables","path":"cmd\\api\\.env"}

### API Endpoints <a name = "endpoints"></a>
A full ist is documented using swagger, but here is a quick runwdown:
1. **GET /v1/healthcheck:** Checks the health of the application. Returns a 200 OK status code if the application is running correctly.

2. **POST /v1/users:** Registers a new user.

3. **PUT /v1/users/activated:** Activates a user.

4. **POST /v1/api/authentication:** Creates an authentication token.

5. **GET /debug/vars:** Provides debug variables from the `expvar` package. 


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The project has existing tests represented by files ending with the word `"_test"` e.g `internal_helpers_test.go`

### Break down into end to end tests

Each test file contains a myriad of tests to run on various entities mainly functions.
The test files are organized into `structs of tests` and their corresponding test logic.

You can run them directly from the vscode test UI. Below represents test results for the scraper:

```bash
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-128_key_(16_bytes)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-128_key_(16_bytes) (0.00s)
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-192_key_(24_bytes)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-192_key_(24_bytes) (0.00s)
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-256_key_(32_bytes)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey/Valid_AES-256_key_(32_bytes) (0.00s)
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey/Invalid_key_length_(0_bytes)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey/Invalid_key_length_(0_bytes) (0.00s)
=== RUN   Test_generateSecurityKey/Invalid_key_length_(-1_bytes)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey/Invalid_key_length_(-1_bytes) (0.00s)
--- PASS: Test_generateSecurityKey (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest/internal/data  0.674s
```
- <b>All other tests follow a similar prologue.</b>

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
As earlier mentioned, the api uses a myriad of flags which you can use to launch the application.
An example of launching the application with your `smtp server's setting` includes:
```bash
make build/api ## build api using the makefile
./bin/api.exe -smtp-username=pigbearman -smtp-password=algor ## run the built api with your own values

Direct Run: 
go run main.go
```
