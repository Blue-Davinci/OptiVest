## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run or contribute to this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The project is written in Go, so you'll need to have Go installed to run or modify the code.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/): The project uses a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed and know how to create a database.
- A Go IDE or text editor: While not strictly necessary, a Go IDE or a text editor with Go support can make it easier to work with the code. I use vscode.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): You'll need Git to clone the repo.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): OptiVest uses Redis for caching to enhance performance and reduce API load.
- [OptiVest-Predictor-Microservice](https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest_Finance_Predictor_Micro_Service_V1): Clone and ser up this micro-service, which is esential for financial predictions and recommendations
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/OptiVest.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd optivest
    ```
3. **Install the Go dependencies:** The Go tools will automatically download and install the dependencies listed in the `go.mod` file when you build or run the project. To download the dependencies without building or running the project, you can use the `go mod download` command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
